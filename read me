Hello my name is Mamuka. I want to show you my project.It about bikes selling in the world. I took this dataset from www.kaggle.com. So, let's get started. 
For creating the project I used Python library Pandas and Tableau for visualization.
The goal of this project is to answer the following questions:
- Prepare dataset 
- What types of products are in the dataset?
- What are the top orders?
- Show orders lower than average
- Show data depends on gender

And the major goal of this project: show that data analysis it's important sector and really interesting.
